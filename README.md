#Three Points Lab 
##Goal
Your assignment is to write a C++ program that will read three points and will determine if the points represent a line or a triangle, the program will output information about the line or triangle depending the case. This project will help you practicing:

C++ editing, running and debugging
ID, variables, types
Functions
Control structures
##Sample Run
Input Point 1: 2 1
Input Point 1: 3 4
Input Point 1: 5 1
A Triangle
Sides:
  3.16
  3.61
  3.00
Angles:
  0.98
  1.25
  0.91
Perimeter:   9.77
Area:        4.50

##Detailed Explanation
When you run the program, it will ask the user to input three points. The program then will check whether the points form a line or a triangle.

*If the points make up a line the program will output:
The slope of the line
The length of the segment formed by the three points
*If the points make up a triangle the program will output:
The length of the sides
The interior angles
The triangle perimeter
The triangle area
The points may form a vertical line, in which case you must only output: Infinite Slope and exit the program.
Your program should output the exact same format as it is shown in the sample runs section of this document. The assessment of this activity will be done automatically, and the script will check if your output matches exactly the output of the given cases.
